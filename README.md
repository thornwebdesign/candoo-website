# Website Build from Scratch: CanDoTech Clone

This project is a step-by-step guide to building a complete website from scratch, using [CanDoTech](https://www.candootech.com/) as a reference. This tutorial is aimed at developers interested in understanding the full lifecycle of website development, from initial HTML structuring to advanced React component implementation.

## Project Overview

We will start by creating all sections and components first in HTML template files. This initial phase will help us establish the base structure of the site and the foundational CSS for the outer elements. Subsequently, we will move onto creating a React-based site, where each section of the original HTML structure will be transformed into individual React components.

### Key Phases:

1. **HTML & CSS Foundation**: Building the basic structure and styling of the website using HTML and CSS.
2. **React Development**: Translating the HTML structure into React components, integrating state management and dynamic content.
3. **Enhancement**: Adding advanced features and optimizations to improve the website's functionality and user experience.

### Tools and Technologies:

- HTML/CSS
- React.js
- Additional libraries and tools (to be determined)
